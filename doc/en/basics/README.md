# Basics

Now that we have set up our development environment, let's get started by creating a simple web page with an  OpenLayers map, and add some animation and interactivity to it.

* [Creating a map](map.md)
* [Zooming to your location](geolocation.md)
* [Drawing a point at your location](point-feature.md)
* [Showing a popup on feature click](popup.md)
