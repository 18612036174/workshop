# OpenLayers Workshop

Welcome to the **OpenLayers 3 Workshop**. This workshop is designed to
give you a comprehensive overview of OpenLayers as a web mapping solution.  The
exercises assume that you have gone through the [setup steps](setup.md) to
install dependencies and start the development server.

This workshop is presented as a set of modules. In each module the reader will
perform a set of tasks designed to achieve a specific goal for that module. Each
module builds upon lessons learned in previous modules and is designed to
iteratively build up the reader's knowledge base.

The following modules will be covered in this workshop:

* [Basics](basics/README.md) - Learn how to add a map to a webpage with OpenLayers.
* [Layers and Sources](layers/README.md) - Learn about layers and sources.
* [Controls and Interactions](controls/README.md) - Learn about using map controls and interactions.
* [Vector Topics](vector/README.md) - Explore vector layers in depth.
