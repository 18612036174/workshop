# Creating a Map

In OpenLayers, a map is a collection of layers and various interactions and controls for dealing with user interaction. A map is generated with three basic ingredients: markup, style declarations, and initialization code.

## Working Example

Let's take a look at a fully working example of an OpenLayers map.

Create this `index.html`:

[import](../examples/xyz/index.html)

And this `main.js`:

[import](../examples/xyz/main.js)

### Tasks

1.  Make sure you've completed the [setup instructions](../) to install dependencies and get the debug server running.

1.  Copy the text above into a new file called `map.html`, and save it in the root of the workshop directory.

1.  Open the working map in your web browser: {{ book.workshopUrl }}/map.html

Having successfully created our first map, we'll continue by looking more closely at [the parts](./dissect.md).
