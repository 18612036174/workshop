Workshop Setup
==============

The workshop documentation assumes that you have a copy of workshop package on your machine.  In addition, you'll need `Node
<https://nodejs.org/>`_  installed to run a development server for the OpenLayers library.

The remaining workshop dependencies are installed with ``npm`` (which comes with Node).

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install

Next, start the development server:

.. code-block:: bash

    npm install

This will start a development server where you can read the workshop documentation and work through the exercises: :workshop_url:`doc/`.
