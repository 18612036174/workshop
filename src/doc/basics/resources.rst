OpenLayers Resources
====================

The OpenLayers library contains a wealth of functionality. Though the developers have worked hard to provide examples of that functionality and have organized the code in a way that allows other experienced developers to find their way around, may users find it a challenge to get started from scratch.

Learn by Example
----------------

New users will most likely find diving into the OpenLayer's example code and experimenting with the library's possible functionality the most useful way to begin.
