# Setup

The documentation assumes that you have a copy of workshop package on your machine.  In addition, you'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run a development server for the OpenLayers library.

The remaining workshop dependencies are installed with `npm` (which comes with Node).

    npm install

Next, start the development server:

    npm start

This will start a development server where you can read the workshop documentation and work through the exercises: {{ book.workshopUrl }}.
